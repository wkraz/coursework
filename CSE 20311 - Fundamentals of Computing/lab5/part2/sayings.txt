I like criticism, it makes you strong.
I don't read books much.
I treated it like every day was my last day with a basketball.
I don't know how tall I am or how much I weigh. Because I don't want anybody to know my identity. I'm like a superhero. Call me Basketball Man.
I laugh and joke, but I don't get distracted very easily.
Volleyball, I could be pretty good. After a few practices I could be that striker, or whatever they call it.
In fourth grade, I missed 82 days of school. Out of 160.
I'm just a little kid from Akron.
I'm a pretty funny guy, and I would love to do a comedy with a bunch of funny guys - movie-star guys, where they could help me through it.
CLEVELAND!
