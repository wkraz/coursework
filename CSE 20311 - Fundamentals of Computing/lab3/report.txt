Lab report

User perspective:
    The user is asked to input a number 1-5: 1=addition, 2=subtraction,
    3=multiplication, 4=division, 5=exit.
    If they choose 5, the program ends.
    They are then asked to input two numbers.
    Then depending on the numbers chosen and the operation chosen, the user
    is displayed the result of number1 __operation__ number2.
    Then the program runs again and continues until they choose 5 to exit.

Programmer's perspective:
    In lines 12-19 I used function prototypes to call functions I'd use later.
    In line 23 I initialized a while True loop
    In line 26, I called a user defined function to get the operation choice from the user
    In lines 29-33 I checked to see if the user wants to exit.
        If so, I printed an exit message and break the while True loop.
    In lines 36-37 I used user-functions to get the two numbers from the user.
    In line 40 I call a user function to get the result from the user input.
    In lines 43-75 I look at the operation and print an appropriate result message: + for addition, - for subtraction, etc.
    In line 78 I return 0 to show the while True loop was exited successfully.
    In lines 81-89 I create the get_operation function, which just gets user input for an int 1-5 and returns it.
    In lines 91-105 I create the get_number functions which just simply get user input and return a double.
    In lines 107-125 I create add, subtract, multiply, divide functions. Very straightforward.
    In lines 127-152 I create the computation function which takes all user inputs in and returns the appropriate double value.

Verifying validity:
    To verify this, I did multiple examples with each operation and they all worked.
    I then tried dividing by 0, and saw that I got an error message.
    I then pressed 5 to exit and it worked, so I concluded this program works.
