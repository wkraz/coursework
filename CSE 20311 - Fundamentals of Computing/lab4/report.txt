User's perspective:
    From the user's perspective, they run the program and are given 6 choices:
    1. Display the record for a given year
    2. Display years with at least 'n' losses
    3. Display years with at least 'n' wins
    4. Display years with at least 'n' more wins than losses
    5. Display the record for the previous 5 years for a given year
    6. Exit

    They then choose one of these, and 1 of 6 things happens:
        1 - they are prompted to enter a year, and the record for that year is displayed if it's a valid year (1900-current year)
        2 - they are prompted to enter a number 'n' of losses, and every year that has >= n losses is displayed along with the wins/losses
        3 - they are prompted to enter a number 'n' of wins, and every year that has >= n wins is displayed along with the wins/losses
        4 - they are prompted to enter a number 'n' of the difference between wins and losses, and every year that has >= n difference is displayed along with the wins/losses
        5 - they are prompted to enter a year, and the records for the previous 5 years are displayed if it's a valid year (1905-current year)
        6 - they are displayed an exit message and the program ends

Programmer's perspective:
    Lines 8 - 38 include libraries and the global arrays we need
    Line 40 calculates the size of the arrays and stores it in NUM_YEARS
    Lines 43 - 47 are function prototypes
    Lines 50 - 130 are the main function
        Line 53 initializes choice as an int with an arbitrary value
        Lines 55 - 127 are a while loop with the condition choice != 6
            Lines 58 - 66 print the menu to the user and store their choice in choice
            Lines 69 - 126 are a switch statement that run the appropriate function depending on the user's choice
        Line 129 returns 0 to show the program was successful
    Lines 132 - 147 are display_record_for_year function
        Takes an int: year 
        Line 135 gets the index we're in in the arrays by year - 1900
        line 138 checks to make sure it's a valid year
        Line 141 prints the year and the wins/losses 
        Line 145 prints invalid if it's not valid
    Lines 149 - 162 are display_years_with_min_losses function
        Takes an int: min_losses
        line 151 displays what's happening to the user
        Lines 155 - 161 are a foor loop that goes through the loss array, checks if each entry is >= min_losses, and displays the year + wins/losses if so 
    Lines 165 - 178 are display_years_with_min_wins function 
        Takes an int: min_wins
        line 167 displays what's happening to the user
        Lines 171 - 177 are a foor loop that goes through the win array, checks if each entry is >= min_wins, and displays the year + wins/losses if so 
    Lines 181 - 194 are the display_years_with_wins_more_than_losses function
        Takes an int: difference
        line 183 displays what's happening to the user
        Lines 187 - 193 are a foor loop that goes through the arrays, checks if wins[i] - loss[i] is >= difference, and displays the year + wins/losses if so 
    Lines 197 - 220 are the display_record_for_last_5_years function
        Takes an int: year
        line 202 checks to see if year is between 1905-current year
            Line 204 prints 'record for previous 5 years'
            Lines 206 - 209 display the past 5 years and their wins/losses
        Line 214 displays an error message indicating year is between 1900-1904
        Line 218 displays an error message: invalid

How I tested:
    I ran the program and went down the list by function sequentially
    I started with function 1 and entered 1900, 2023, and a couple others and noticed the records were correct
    I then did function 2 and did a couple different n's and noticed everything displayed indeed had >= n losses
    I then did function 3 and did the same thing, but with wins and noticed it was also correct
    I then did function 4 and a very similar thing, all the differences were >= difference
    Then for 5 I did 2023 and saw it display 2018-2022 records, and I did 1904 and got an error message
    I then pressed 6 and the exit message displayed and the program ended
    So, my program works for all 6 functions
