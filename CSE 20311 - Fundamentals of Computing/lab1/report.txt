For my second program, I created a program that calculates the volume of a cone using the formula:
V = pi * r^2 * (h/3)

User's perspective:
    The purpose of prog2.c is to calculate the volume of a cone in cubic meters. First, the user is asked to input the radius of the cone
    in meters. Then the user is asked to input the height of the cone in meters. Finally, the program outputs the volume of the cone
    in cubic meters.

Programmer's perspective:
    In line 13 we use printf to display the purpose of the program: finding the volume of a cone
    In lines 15-16 we initialize all our variables and set PI = 3.14
    In lines 19-23 we use scanf to get the user's inputs to the radius and height
    In lines 26-27, we calculate the volume from the volume formula and use printf to display the result to the user

I tested the results multiple times with multiple edge case values of the radius and height, and it gave me correct results in all cases.
Hence, my program works correctly.
